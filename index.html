<H2>Lone Peak</H2>
<p>In the Northern Rockies isolated from any major populations is Lone Peak, the summit of Big Sky Mountain. The mountain has not always been accessible to ski and towered over the resort for the majority of its history, but a single-cab tram was constructed in 2003 to shuttle <b>fourteen skiers  every 12 minutes</b>, which is very inefficient when regarding there is a whole mountain to ski.</p>

 <H2>Highland Bowl</H2>
 <p>At the peak of Aspens least popular of its four mountains, <i>Aspen Highlands</i>, is the Highland Bowl. The bowl is rarely skied since you cannot get to the top by lifts. There is an open cab ski cat that transports your group a third of the distance to the peak from the ski patrol station, but once the ridge gets steep and narrow the only way up is to hike. After the leg wrenching three fourth mile high altitude ascent and a necessary scenic break is an unparalleled skiing terrain called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcountry_skiing">Backcountry</a>; nothing less of a dream come true for a skier used to the Appalachians. </p>

  <H2>Mott Canyon</H2>
 <p>The least notorious of the three areas is Mott Canyon, a face of Heavenly Mountain in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The face does not span over much vertical but is still undeniably steep. This was the first big mountain skiing I have ever done and only had the idea of doing it when my parents instructed my brother and I to <q> Stay away from Mott Canyon when you two are skiing alone</q>, and quite honestly I don’t think I should have. </p>
